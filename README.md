# 3D-Helicopter-Game-

Helicopter game in the style of Angry Bird. However, with 3D assets

The Helicopter can collect coins as it travels or gems for more points and crashes upon collision with buildings and airplanes.

A particle system is started upon collection of gems and the game gets faster with time and resets to normal speed once we die and restart the game (Usage of static variables with C#).

The Background testure is continuously scrolled and looped over to simulate a continuous journey for the helicopter.
